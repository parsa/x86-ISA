> I needed a parsable copy of Intel's x86 instruction set documentation for a
> personal project, so I downloaded volumes 2A and 2B of the *IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32
> Architectures Software Developer's Manual* (which can be found [here][1] and
> [here][2], respectively), and used a online PDF-to-HTML tool to transform them
> to HTML files. Unfortunately, the result was beyond terrible and absolutely
> unusable.
> 
> They say that you're never better served than by yourself, so I took the matter
> into my own, [pdfminer][3]-gloved hands to extract HTML pages straight from the
> documentation PDF themselves.
> 
> This is still not perfect, but it's already much better than the other solution
> (and it doesn't involve an ugly third-party).
> 
> How To Run
> ----------
> 
> 1. Install [`pdfminer`][3];
> 2. Get yourself a copy of the [Volume A][1] and [Volume B][2] PDFs.
> 3. `pdfminer` doesn't understand how these are encrypted, so print them to PDF,
> 	both starting only from the first instruction in the document (not the whole
> 	document);
> 4. Run `python extract.py vol2a.pdf vol2b.pdf`;
> 5. Go grab a coffee;
> 6. Enjoy your documentation set.
> 
> The set is also available online at [felixcloutier.com/x86][4].
